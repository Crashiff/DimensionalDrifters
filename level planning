1D:
*idea: 1D will be mostly an introduction  video, the players will be able to control the characters  for a short time 
*idea: easy stage with two buttons - need to press at same time to open the door


2D:


2D--->3D:
*idea: with press of a button players can change the axis they walk on



3D: (players will have split screen here)
*idea: maze, each player starts at the other side of the maze. they need to meet in the center and solve some riddles in the middle


3D-->4D:
*idea: with press of a button players can change the axis they walk on
*task: research  the open source library we found to create 4D objects


general ideas: 
*the antagonist  will have a shape, and the players will need to find what shape he is to hurt him (inspiration: Bill from gravity falls)
* every few levels the playres will fight the boss, until his final form in the last level 
*time freeze level - every X time one player freezes while the other can keep playing. after X time they switch - he first player
can move again and the second freezes. X will get smaller and smaller as time passes. 
the reason for the freeze: the player that freezes is trapped in another dimension  (by the antoganist)
*water stage: use water current to pass objects/advance in some way (2D?)
